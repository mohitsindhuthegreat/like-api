# Free Fire Token Generator Service

## Project Overview
This is a Flask API service for Free Fire game-like bot functionality with multi-server support and encrypted communication. The service includes automatic token generation for multiple accounts across different regions (India and Pakistan).

## Current Features
- Free Fire game API service with like functionality
- Multi-server support for different regions (IND, PK, BD, BR, SG)

  - Implemented scheduled real JWT token generation every 4 hours
  - System runs completely built-in without web dashboard interface
  - Successfully generating authentic JWT tokens for both India and Pakistan regions
  - Using exact same algorithm as provided working JWT generator
  - Tokens are automatically saved to tokens/ind.json and tokens/pk.json

## Project Architecture
- **Main Application**: Flask API in `main.py`
- **Core App**: Base Flask setup in `app/`
- **Token Management**: Region-specific token files in `tokens/`
- **Account Data**: Account credentials in `IND_ACC.json` and `PK_ACC.json`
- **Encryption**: AES encryption and protobuf handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy

## User Preferences
- Non-technical user requiring simple explanations
- Focus on functionality over technical details
- Prefers automatic solutions over manual interventions
- Wants everything built-in without web dashboard interface
- Prefers automatic background operation

## Account Structure
- **IND_ACC.json**: Contains India region accounts with guest UIDs and passwords
- **PK_ACC.json**: Contains Pakistan region accounts with guest UIDs and passwords
- Both files store encrypted guest account credentials for token generation

## Token Generation Requirements
- Generate REAL JWT tokens for all accounts in IND_ACC.json and PK_ACC.json
- Save India tokens to `tokens/ind.json`
- Save Pakistan tokens to `tokens/pk.json`
- Automatically regenerate every 4 hours
- Use complete JWT generation process with protobuf, AES encryption, and Garena API
- Generate authentic tokens using exact same algorithm as provided working source code

## How to Add More Accounts
Your system currently processes:
- **578 India accounts** from IND_ACC.json (MERGED - guest_account_info structure)
- **99 Pakistan accounts** from PK_ACC.json

To add more accounts:
1. **For India accounts**: Add to IND_ACC.json in this format:
```json
{
    "guest_account_info": {
        "com.garena.msdk.guest_uid": "1234567890",
        "com.garena.msdk.guest_password": "64_CHARACTER_HEX_PASSWORD"
    }
}
```

2. **For Pakistan accounts**: Add to PK_ACC.json in this format:
```json
{"guest_account_info":{"com.garena.msdk.guest_uid":"1234567890","com.garena.msdk.guest_password":"64_CHARACTER_HEX_PASSWORD"}}
```

The system will automatically:
- Detect and validate new accounts on restart
- Generate JWT tokens for all valid accounts  
- Use ALL tokens for like requests (no limits)
- Support both old and new account formats seamlessly
